tictactoe in C#
I included this note at the end of the Program.cs file.
Although I got help from this website I still made it my own and worked along with the steps to understand them.

//Partial inspiration was from https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/75a48f/tic-tac-toe-game-in-C-Sharp/
//However, I still typed this %95 by hand and added fucntionality for vertical win conditions, among many smaller differences
//I used the above website to correct some issues I was struggling with
